# Unclosed File Bug in Python

This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: forgetting to close a file after opening it.  This can lead to resource leaks and potential issues.

The `bug.py` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.py` presents the correct implementation with proper file closure. Always ensure to close your files to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure proper resource management.
